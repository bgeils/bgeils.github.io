title: Turning your world upside down
---

I’m writing this post in response to Ryan Allias’, “Lesson’s From My 20s,” (hive.org/20s). The “article” is a set of over 1,000 slides that go into detail on how Allias approaches life, entrepreneurship, and the world. The slides are in a very specific sequence to more easily approach your life and goals.

What you can expect to gain from reading his slides:

* A well defined life purpose
* Goals that align with your purpose
* Extravagant Bucket List
* Better understanding of your friends (or who they should be)
* Clear understanding of your “path”
* Address habits and make changes where needed
* Personalized financial plan
* And much more
If you are as busy as most people you know that entrepreneurship alone can be a handful. Taking the time to think of an idea, and see that idea to fruition can be a daunting task. Many entrepreneurs fail in building a business because they don’t have the passion to see it through. In Allias’ slides he addresses in many parts that your passion for an idea must be extreme if you want to succeed and make a positive difference in the world. Allias’ commends the best way to be passionate about a business is to have it align with your life purpose.

I challenge you to stop for one minute and think what is your true life purpose? Does something come to mind? Have you ever thought of what your life purpose should be?

To be truly successful in entrepreneurship have your business idea align with your life purpose.

Why?

When you are spending countless hours building teams, developing products and marketing your solutions for a startup that aligns with your life purpose you won’t work a day in your life. Having the passion behind an idea will give you the motivation to make it through the toughest of times.

Take some time to sit down and read through Ryan Allias’ slides at www.hive.org/20s and define your life purpose. A well-defined life purpose might just turn your world upside down, as it did mine.
