A point on money.

For this post I'll do my best to keep it concise and empirical. We are going to scratch the surface of what current "sound" investment advice is.

No this isn't going to be the sound advice I am referring to. Rather let's talk about the less sexy, but proven strategy of investing in index funds.

I was inspired to write this after listening to the following podcast:
http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/

What is an index fund?

Formal Definition: An index fund is a type of mutual fund with a porfolio constructed to match or track the components of a market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover.

A simpler and naive definition: 
An index fund is an investment type that someone can purchase that is designed to closely follow a fund, for example the S&P500.
Characteristics:
- Broad (opposite of a stock)
- Low expenses 

As I write this I am avidly following Ethereum's price moving in and out of the market... wait I thought you said that isn't sound investment advice. You're right. As behaviorial economics has shown us we are not rational creatures. I justify my small day trading activites as a sort of entertainment cost. Nothing more and nothing less. 

If there is enough interest I'll create a post on how to invest in index funds.
