## Quantum Visualization (Harvard's Hackathon)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/qcviz.gif){: .center-image }

Here is a [link](http://qchackers.com) to test out the tool.


I believe quantum computing has unquantifiable potential within the next 25 years. Given the close relationship with electrical and software engineering, I was drawn to understand how this technology can shape my generation. After attending Harvard's hackathon I had the opportunity to carve a niche within this field. Our team built a quantum simulator for visualizing quantum programs (here). As the hardware race closes there will be a need for the "Code Academy" of quantum programming. 


## Energy Platform 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/energyblockchain.png){: .center-image }

An energy platform solution that allows consumers to efficiently trade their energy directly at a house to house level – allowing them to save money and maximise the use of their solar and wind energy. The project's humble beginnings was a blockchain implentation in IBM's Hyperledger technology. The next revision was ported to Ethereum. The most recent repo boasts a classic web app that allows for more throughput and quicker development cycles.

## Future Founders Fellowship

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/futurefounders.jpeg){: .center-image }

One of 17 entrepreneurs selected to join a 12-month program to assist in their ventures through high caliber mentors, resources, and a strong peer group. Representing 15 schools in nine states the program is nationwide. The represented industries include agriculture, consumer products, food and tech.

Throughout the fellowship I was able to grow Sodima Solutions by expanding into our first product, Atlas Fitness, while building communication technology for multiple start ups, Terva & Structurely -- details below.

## Sodima Solutions

Sodima had its humble beginnings in Miami, Fl during Florida International University's Spring Hackathon. I met my co-founder Marcellus G. during the event, where we immediately clicked. The following months we spend working as a pair with a focus on web services and digital marketing. As we grew into the communication space we had the opporunity to work heavily with two startups, Structurely & Terva, bringing their ideas to an MVP and product release. During the 20 months at Sodima Solutions our company secured revenue of ~100k and equity in multiple startups.

## Atlas Fitness

Atlas was the first product Sodima realeased. Atlas Fitness is a chatbot for helping people get to consitently get to the gym. The technology also featured products and workouts that our clients could configure. In three months we grew to ~1k users and ~7 clients including gyms in NYC and Miami. During the release Atlas was named the #1 fitness chatbot and #3 health chatbot

### Structurely [link](https://structurely.com)

One of Sodima's first contracts was for Structurely. We had been tasked to build an artifically intelligent chat technology for their real estate company. The project was a finalist for Inman's Most Innovative Technology in real estate in 2016. Our company had the opportunity to build three iterations of this technology. The first iteration was selected to demo at Facebook's HQ. Additionally, Sodima was hired to build a full database system, API, and front end customer portal. Today over 3,500 agents from across 39 states are using this technology to help with their job of selling the right home to people. 

Tech Stack: React, Redux, GraphQL, Node, Meteor, PSQL, AWS, Digital Ocean, nginx, python ML kits, API.AI, Flask.

#### Days to Sell

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/daystosell.png){: .center-image }

At an SF hackathon our team designed an algorithm for picking a price to sell your home given the number of days you are willing to wait. The algorithm is patent pending. During this hackathon I learned various clustering algorithms and various data visualization techniques. Also, this was the first time I was introduced to Jupyter notebooks, I haven't looked back since.

### Terva [link](http://landing.terva.ag/)

Another client I landed for Sodima was Terva, a craigslist for farmland. The company was tasked with building a web application the allowed users to search for land for sale and interact with it accordingly. Our system incorporated a database with millions of documents that were served over in GeoJSON to visualize. 

Tech Stack: Meteor, Digital Ocean, Flask, Python, Mapbox/Leaflet, MongoDB


## Moralit.ai (Princeton's Hackathon)

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/moralit.png){: .center-image }


Moralit.ai is an artificially intelligent personal assistant which uses natural language processing and machine learning to perform moral decision making. By adhering to deontological principles surrounding murder, suffering, adultery, and deception, moralit.it determines the ethical permissibility of performing action requests from the user. My role was to build the machine learning processor to use general consensus sentiment on a subject to make a decision. Over time this system would self correct. 


Tech Stack: Node.js, Express, mySQL, NLP models

## Palantir (Deployment Strategist Internship)

* Summer 2017 - London, UK

## SpaceX (Instrumentation & RangeOps Internship, Cape Canaveral, FL)

* Spring 2016

As a instrumentation and comm intern my focus was on designing and implementing systems for ground control to reliably launch Falcon 9 rockets. During my time at the Cape I helped launch  and, fingers crossed, land five Falcon 9 rockets at LC-40 and SLC-39A. The majority of my time was spend on 39A projects. This is the same space launch complex as the Apollo missions from '63 to '72. Part of the 39A work was associated with pad completion for Falcon Heavy. I also worked with the payload and Dragon install implementing an end-to-end hazard-safe communication system for pre-flight operations.
