## Open Energy Platform 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/energyscreen.png){: .center-image }

Open Energy is an energy platform that allows consumers to efficiently trade energy at a consumer level â€“ allowing them to save money and improve the sustainability of the grid. The project began with a blockchain implementation in IBM's Hyperledger technology during a hackathon in the Netherlands. Our team of three took home the 5000 euro grand prize for prototyping the marketplace. After the hackathon I opted to pursue the project further after speaking with Engie and Shell, two utilities.

 The next iteration occured at UltraHacks a hackathon in Helsinki, Finland. I decided to port the blockchain component to Ethereum as it became the standard. The Ethereum platform had a more active community and abundant resources to leverage. 

 The most recent iteration boasts a classic database that allows for more throughput and quicker development cycles compared to its blockchain peer. With the help of Iowa State University the project was accepted as a  senior design capstone project

There is [evidence](http://www.solarcity.com/sites/default/files/SolarCity_Distributed_Grid-021016.pdf) that a distributed grid has a net positive benefit for society. The issue arises in that there is little incentive to implement this system. The incentive is spread out over the masses while the few parties that benefit from the current model lobby to keep it with a strong presence. 

The mission for Open Energy is to break down these barriers, by creating an environment for peer to peer energy transactions. In certain locations there are solar or wind installations that produce energy at a cost cheaper than the grid. By allowing individuals the opportunity to buy this energy you 1. incentivize the producer to purchase more clean energy installations and 2. save money for the consumer. There a myriad of other benefits including lower transmission costs, infrastructure, and a reduction in energy buffers for a utility.

## Quantum Visualization -- Harvard's Hackathon

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/qcviz.gif){: .center-image }

As quantum hardware is progressing there is a future where a programmer would execute certain portions of their programs on a quantum computer. To assist in the paradigm shift that software and hardware are going through in the quantum realm, our team built a quantum VM and visualization tool. The best case scenario is a future where this tool becomes the Code Academy for the quantum programmers. After researching optical and ion based quantum implementations I joined a team at Harvard to address the software angle of quantum. 

Using the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement certain problems within computer science have exponential speeds ups. Factoring problems and unordered search are two common applications. Our initial design used Regetti's quantum API to process the programs we wrote in QUIL, what we dub the assembly language of quantum computers. After Regetti's server went down we were forced into implementing our own quantum virtual machine. The basic gates we needed to implement in a universal gate set were X, Y, Z and CNOT. 

*Want to try the visualizer out yourself? [Here you go.](http://qchackers.com)*

Code snippet to try out
```js
X 0 
X 0
MEASURE 0 [1]
```
The X Gate performs a rotation of pi around the x axis.

## Sodima Solutions -- Co-Founder/CEO

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/sodima.jpg){: .center-image }

* 2015 - 2016 -- Miami, FL

Sodima had its humble beginnings in Miami, FL during Florida International University's Spring Hackathon. I met my co-founder Marcellus G. during the event, where we immediately clicked. The following months we spend working as a pair with a focus on web services and digital marketing. As we grew into the communication space we had the opportunity to work heavily with two startups, Structurely & Terva, bringing their ideas to an MVP and product release. During the 20 months at Sodima Solutions our company secured revenue of ~100k and equity in multiple startups.

During the web development phase of the business I interviewed clients, build solutions, and maintained them. Marcellus would find and make the sale, passing off the client to me. We built the majority of our web services in wordpress or other highly managed systems. This allowed us to easily maintain the project and hand it off to our client upon completion. This taught me basic web technologies -- HTML, CSS, JS -- and more importantly how to work with our clients. Adjacent to the technology stack I grew into the finance and legal role. I drafted all our contracts prior to having professional review -- a decision that saved us big time. The finances were fairly straight forward while operating in a consulting business allowing cashflow to rarely be an issue. 

Given the competitive landscape in web services we began to position ourselves to take on larger web applications and more specifically communciation technology.

* Revenue: +$100K
* Products: Atlas Fitness
* Major Clients: Terva, Structurely
* +15 web development clients
* NewCo Helsinki Accelerator -- Finland
* StartUp FIU Accelerator -- Florida International Unviersity
* Sodima Solutions owns equity in the following two companies: 
	* [Structurely](https://structurely.com) 5%
	* [Terva](https://terva.ag) 4%

#### Days to Sell

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/daystosell.png){: .center-image }

At an SF hackathon our team designed an algorithm for picking a price to sell your home given the number of days you are willing to wait. The algorithm is patent pending. During this hackathon I learned various clustering algorithms and various data visualization techniques. Also, this was the first time I was introduced to Jupyter notebooks, I haven't looked back since.

### Terva

## SpaceX -- Instrumentation & RangeOps Internship

* Spring 2016 -- Cape Canaveral, FL

As an instrumentation and comm intern my focus was on designing and implementing systems for ground control to reliably launch Falcon 9 rockets. During my time at the Cape I helped launch and, fingers crossed, land five Falcon 9 rockets at LC-40 and SLC-39A. The majority of my time was spend on 39A projects. This is the same space launch complex as the Apollo missions from '63 to '72. Part of the 39A work was associated with pad completion for Falcon Heavy. I also worked with the payload and Dragon install implementing an end-to-end hazard-safe communication system for pre-flight operations.

## Defining Experiences

To better understand my personality, what makes me tick and some more impressionable moments in my life I've put together my most defining experiences. While working in teams I belive it is important to be vulnerable and open. The most effective way that I can be open with a new team is to understand their experiences and have them understand mine. 

#### Almost Abroad

As a studying electrical engineer the computer science field was always very interesting to me, but I felt I never had a chance to break into the market given my "path" was set in electrical engineering. The tipping point came when I was two weeks out from study abroad semester of lax living and reluctant studying in Spain. I knew this trip would be an eye opening cultural experience, but I would neglect my growing interest in computer science. 

After weighing my options, I canceled the trip. This was a turning point in my life. I spent the subsequent months absorbing as much as I could in order to at the time get the "Google" dream job. This goal overtime faded as I understood the potential I had within the field. Studying computer science for those three months I learned something more important than the most efficient way to traverse a binary tree, but how I could change effect global systems such as quantum computing and energy markets. The following year I did just that. I worked at SpaceX, Palantir, and a company I co-founded, Sodima Solutions.

Having reviewed the companies attending my university's career fair I booked a flight to UCLA to attend theirs with a focus on gettin a technology internship. While boarding the flight I recieved the email from UCLA's career staff stating I was not to attend the fair less I was an enrolled UCLA student. The wheels sputtered up and I was on my way to California from small town Iowa. With a bit of luck I was able to get into the fair and landed interviews over the next few months with Palantir, Google, Microsoft, American Express, IBM, SpaceX and Bloomberg. 

I wrote a blog post shortly after [here](http://brendongeils.com/Following-passions/).

#### Hackathons

Having only attended my first hackathon during my third year of college I was behind the curve when it came to these events. I quickly
