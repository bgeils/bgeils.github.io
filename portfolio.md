Open Energy is an energy platform that allows consumers to efficiently trade energy at a consumer level – allowing them to save money and improve the overall sustainability of the grid. Open Energy began with a blockchain implementation in IBM’s Hyperledger technology during a hackathon event in the Netherlands. My team of three took home the € 5,000 grand prize for prototyping this energy marketplace. After the hackathon, I opted to pursue the project further after speaking with two popular utility companies: Engie and Shell.

The next iteration of this platform occurred at UltraHacks in Helsinki, Finland. I decided to port the blockchain component to Ethereum as it became the standard in blockchain. The Ethereum platform had a more active community and abundant resources to leverage.

The most recent iteration boasts a classic database that allows for more throughput and quicker development cycles compared to its blockchain peer. The project was later accepted as my senior design capstone project at Iowa State University.

The mission for Open Energy is to break down incentive barriers within the energy grid and produce a net positive benefit for the masses rather than the few parties that benefit from the current model through creating an environment for peer to peer energy transactions. 

In certain locations, there are solar or wind installations that produce energy cheaper than the grid. Allowing individuals the opportunity to purchase this renewable energy incentivizes the producer to purchase more clean energy installations and saves money for the buyer. There are a [myriad of other benefits](http://www.solarcity.com/sites/default/files/SolarCity_Distributed_Grid-021016.pdf){:target="_blank"} including lower transmission costs, more stable infrastructure, and a reduction in energy buffers for a utility. 

As we collect data, we can help enable grids to provide a real time billing system. [Studies](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12053-012-9169-3){:target="_blank"} estimate a reduction of energy consumption by 3-5% in many areas by informing the consumer of competitive energy prices throughout the day. This system also uses a smart meter to log consumption and production data.


A number of political barriers exist within municipalities in regards to energy trading, so I’ve shifted Open Energy’s efforts to the private sector for prompt implementation. A Chicago developer is now collaborating to allow our smart meter and trading technology to be installed within their development zoning. By going direct to the developer, Open Energy won’t need municipality approval to share energy as the grid is owned and maintained by the developer.

Open Energy plans to expand our product offerings to a wider audience after proving the benefits from distributed generation, storage, trading, and energy transparency at the developer spectrum.

## Sodima Solutions -- Co-Founder/CEO

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/sodima.jpg){: .center-image }

* 2016 - 2017

Sodima Solutions had its humble beginnings in Miami, FL during Florida International University’s Spring Hackathon. It was here I met Marcellus G., my co-founder, and we immediately clicked. The following months we spent working as a pair with a focus on web services and digital marketing. As we grew into the communication space, we had the opportunity to work heavily with two startups, Structurely & Terva. Our team brought each idea to an MVP and eventual product release. Through the period of 20 months Sodima Solutions secured a revenue of ~100k and acquired equity in multiple startups.

During the web development phase of the business, I interviewed clients, built solutions, and performed continual maintenance. Marcellus would find and make the sale and then direct the client to me. 

The majority of our web services were constructed in Wordpress or other highly managed systems. This allowed us to easily maintain the project and hand it back to our client upon completion. This experience taught me basic web technologies – HTML, CSS, JS – and more importantly how to work with our clients. In addition to the technology development, I grew into the finance and legal role. I drafted all contracts prior to having professional review – a decision that saved the company large amounts of time.

Given the competitive landscape in web services, Sodima began to position itself to take on larger web applications and more specifically communication technology.

* Revenue: +$100K
* Products: Atlas Fitness
* Major Clients: Terva, Structurely
* +15 web development clients

### Structurely 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgeils/bgeils.github.io/master/images/struct_convo.png){: .center-image }

* 2016 - 2017

Structurely was one of Sodima Solution’s earliest contracts. We had been tasked to build an artificially intelligent chat technology for their real estate company. The project was a finalist for Inman’s Most Innovative Technology in real estate in 2016. Our company had the opportunity to build three iterations of this technology. The first iteration was selected to be demonstrated at Facebook’s headquarters. Additionally, Sodima was hired to build a full database system, API, and front-end customer portal. Today over 3,500 agents from across 39 states are using this technology to help sell the right home to their clients.

My role was interviewing and distilling the client’s requests, creating system designs, and helping our team implement the solutions across the stack. As Structurely grew, I focused our engineering efforts on creating front-ends backed by JSON to allow our clients to make on-the-fly edits to their configurations. This allowed our development team to focus on core features and allow the content team to build conversational components separately.

Tech Stack: React, Redux, GraphQL, Node, Meteor, PSQL, AWS, Digital Ocean, nginx, python ML kits, API.AI, Flask, humans (when the convo goes astray)

*The Structurely Team + Brendon*

I was invited to join the Structurely team at an SF hackathon to design an algorithm for picking a price to sell your home given the number of days you are willing to wait. The system is patent pending. During this hackathon I learned various clustering algorithms and data visualization techniques. Also, this was the first time I was introduced to Jupyter notebooks, I haven't looked back since.

### Terva

* 2016 - 2017

Another client for Sodima was Terva, “a Craigslist for farmland.” Sodima Solutions was tasked with building a web application that allowed users to search for available land and interact with it accordingly. Our system incorporated a database with millions of documents that were served in GeoJSON to visualize.

The theme in designing and deploying technology at Terva was scale. It was initially apparent the data was going to be large and messy. We had to plan for a user base which was not technically savvy and were going to be accessing a fairly heavy application. The user experience design solved a number of these issues. Incorporating loading menus with tips and messages made the application feel faster. Using contrasting colors and other design standards helped direct the user’s eye and more easily digest the content.

Tech Stack: Meteor, Digital Ocean, Flask, Python, Mapbox/Leaflet, MongoDB

* 2017

As quantum hardware progresses, it is likely programmers will execute certain portions of their programs on a quantum computer in the near future. To assist with the paradigm shift that software and hardware are going through in the quantum realm, my team built a quantum VM and visualization tool. The best case scenario is a future where this tool becomes the Code Academy for the quantum programmers. After researching optical and ion based quantum implementations I joined a team at Harvard to address the software angle of quantum.

Using the quantum properties of superposition and entanglement certain problems within computer science have exponential speed increases. Factoring problems and unordered search are two common applications. Our initial design used Regetti’s quantum API to process the programs written in QUIL, the assembly language of quantum computers. After Regetti’s server went down we were forced into implementing our own quantum virtual machine. The basic gates we needed to implement in a universal gate set were X, Y, Z and CNOT.

* Spring 2016 -- Cape Canaveral, FL

As an instrumentation and communication intern, I focused on designing and implementing systems for ground control to reliably launch Falcon 9 rockets. During my time at the Cape, I helped launch and (fingers crossed) land five Falcon 9 rockets at LC-40 and SLC-39A. The majority of my time was spent on 39A projects. This is the same space launch complex used in the Apollo missions from 1963-1972. Part of the 39A work was associated with pad completion for Falcon Heavy. I also worked with the payload and Dragon install implementing an end-to-end hazard-safe communication system for pre-flight operations.

## Defining Experiences

To better understand my personality, I’ve put together my most defining experiences. While working in teams I believe it is important to be vulnerable. The most effective way that I can be open with a new team is to understand their experiences and allow them to understand mine.

#### Almost Abroad

Through my study as an electrical engineer, the computer science field was always very interesting to me. I unfortunately felt I never had a chance to break into the market given my “path” was set in electrical engineering. I hit a tipping point two weeks before embarking on a study abroad semester of relaxed living and reluctant studying in Spain. I knew this trip would be an eye opening cultural experience, but I would neglect my growing interest in computer science.

After weighing my options, I canceled the trip. I spent the subsequent months absorbing as much knowledge as I could in order to work towards my “dream job” at Google. This goal faded over time as I fully understood my potential within the field. Studying computer science for those three months, I learned something more than just the most efficient way to traverse a binary tree. I understood how I could affect global systems such as energy markets.

With a desire to gain a CS-focused internship, I booked a flight to UCLA to attend their career fair. I received an email as I boarded my flight from UCLA’s career staff stating I was not to attend the fair unless I was an enrolled UCLA student. The wheels sputtered up and I was on my way to California from small-town Iowa. Through some perseverance and a bit of luck, I was able to sneak into the fair and landed interviews over the next few months with Palantir, Google, Microsoft, American Express, IBM, SpaceX and Bloomberg.

I wrote a blog post shortly after [here](http://brendongeils.com/Following-passions/){:target="_blank"}.

These experiences allowed me to affect global systems in the way I truly hoped. My work for SpaceX, Palantir, and the founding of Sodima Solutions provided me with a full understanding of my own value and talent within the industry. This further galvanized my vision for how I could use my skills to impact the world.

#### Hackathons

Attending hackathons offered me unexpected benefits at every turn. I met my co-founder, my first two clients, landed an internship, and created projects that have transformed my perspective. The all-encompassing energy and chance to interact with people of similar mentalities kept me coming back.

15 on-site hackathons including:

* Hack ISU – Iowa State University
