## Sodima Solutions

Sodima had its humble beginnings in Miami, Fl during Florida International University's Spring Hackathon. I met my co-founder Marcellus G. during the event, where we immediately clicked. The following months we spend working as a pair with a focus on web services and digital marketing. As we grew into the communication space we had the opporunity to work heavily with two startups, Structurely & Terva, bringing their ideas to an MVP and product release. During the 20 months at Sodima Solutions our company secured revenue of ~100k and equity in multiple startups.

#### Internships

* Palantir - Summer 2017 - London, UK
* Palantir - Summer 2016 - New York City, NY

* Procter & Gamble - Summer 2015 - Iowa City, IA

#### Big Picture
* The planet is heating up. There’s no denying that we need to, as a species, do better to protect the world for future generations. There is far too much inefficiency in the current power distribution networks – not only for fossil fuels but also for renewables. And this creates a number of environmental and logistical problems. There are far too many players in the current value chain in the energy industry who offer no value other than to trade – to buy and sell energy. They reap huge profits for doing very little other than marking up and down pricing and making profits.

## Career Objectives:

My goal is to help provide socially responsible technology solutions with a focus on the energy sector. I believe I can provide the most innovate soluitons in the near term by assisting organizations as a consultant. Long term I would like to join or start a company to provide a niche service to the energy sector.
