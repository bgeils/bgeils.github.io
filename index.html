<p>Hi! My name is Brendon Geils. I currently attend Iowa State University studying electrical engineering. I am from Elgin, IL a suburb of Chicago. My fondness for entrepreneurial ventures and technology related businesses has led to the founding of a startup, Sodima Solutions. Building  Sodima Solutions I’ve learned invaluable lessons, which I share in my blog. My current hobbies include chess, philosophy, programming and traveling (cliche we know, who doesn’t).
</p>



<p>Check out my blog for more information regarding technology, entrepreneurship, and programming. The blog is geared towards young entrepreneurs that want to make a positive social impact. Much of the blog contains tips and motivation in business and technology. I included ventures and projects of my own so you can learn from the mistakes I made along the way, and trust me there were plenty.

<h3>What I am currently working on:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Energy Blockchain – The general idea is to allow property owners (commercial & residential) to trade electricity with one another. In some countries the energy provider charges a factor more for the energy they sell compared to the energy they would buy back (feed-in tarif). If someone had the ability to sell the their neighbor they would close this gap with a free market (built on blockchain for security and proof of work). We won a hackathon in the Netherlands , competed in Helsinki, Finland and just finished a virtual hackathon in Dubai with this idea.
